# EXTFileSystem
Programmed a simple EXT Linux filesystem in C using FUSE, an interface that lets users create their own file systems without the need to modify kernel code. The screenshots below show the basic functionality of the program capable of making files, directories and navigating through the filesystem.

An example usage of the filesystem can be seen below.
